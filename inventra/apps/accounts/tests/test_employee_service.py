"""
Place at: apps/accounts/tests/test_employee_service.py

Requires converting apps/accounts/tests.py (single file) into a
apps/accounts/tests/ package first:
    - delete/empty the old apps/accounts/tests.py
    - create apps/accounts/tests/__init__.py
    - drop this file alongside it

Covers EmployeeService.hire() and .fire(), which together implement:
  - the role-based permission matrix for hiring/firing
    (see EmployeeService._check_hire_permission / _check_fire_permission)
  - the "one active Employee per user" invariant, enforced by hire()
    auto-firing any existing active employment before creating a new one
  - the fact that both service methods are @transaction.atomic, so a
    failure partway through must not leave partial writes behind
