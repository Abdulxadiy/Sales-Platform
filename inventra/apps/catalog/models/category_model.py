    A product category, scoped to a tenant.

    Deliberately limited to 2 levels (a category may have a parent, but
    a category that already has a parent may not itself become a
    parent -- enforced in CategoryService, not here) instead of an
    unbounded tree. See Architectures/inventra-yol-xaritasi.md,
    9-bosqich, for the rationale: real shops rarely need more than 2
    levels, and this avoids pulling in a tree library
    (django-mptt/treebeard) for a constraint that's easy to lift later
    if ever needed.
